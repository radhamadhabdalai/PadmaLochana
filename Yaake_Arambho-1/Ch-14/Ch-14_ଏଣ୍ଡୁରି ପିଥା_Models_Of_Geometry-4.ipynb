    "### Random Classification Trees (Single Branch per Data Point)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike in section 9.8, we will assume that each data point passes into just one branch. In a random classification tree, the data are evaluated against a function $q[x]$ that was randomly chosen from a predefined family of possible functions. For example, this might be the response of a randomly chosen filter. The data proceeds one way in the tree if the response of this function exceeds a threshold $\\tau$ and the other way if not.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the functions $q[x]$ are chosen randomly, the threshold $\\tau$ is carefully selected. We select the threshold that maximizes the log-likelihood $L$ of the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L = \\sum_{i=1}^{I} (1 - \\text{heaviside}[q[x_i] - \\tau]) \\log \\text{Cat}_{w_i}[\\lambda^{[l]}] + \\text{heaviside}[q[x_i] - \\tau] \\log \\text{Cat}_{w_i}[\\lambda^{[r]}] \\quad (9.63)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the first term represents the contribution of the data $x_i$ with true class $w_i$ that passes down the left branch (where $q[x_i] \\le \\tau$), and the second term represents the contribution of the data that passes down the right branch (where $q[x_i] > \\tau$). In each case, the data are evaluated against a categorical distribution with parameters $\\lambda^{[l]}$ and $\\lambda^{[r]}$, respectively. These parameters represent the distribution of classes in the left and right child nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters are set using maximum likelihood based on the data partitioned by the threshold $\\tau$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lambda_k^{[l]} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{I} \\delta[w_i - k](1 - \\text{heaviside}[q[x_i] - \\tau])}{\\sum_{i=1}^{I} (1 - \\text{heaviside}[q[x_i] - \\tau])}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lambda_k^{[r]} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{I} \\delta[w_i - k](\\text{heaviside}[q[x_i] - \\tau])}{\\sum_{i=1}^{I} (\\text{heaviside}[q[x_i] - \\tau])} \\quad (9.64)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\lambda_k^{[l]}$ is the proportion of data points in the left branch belonging to class $k$, and $\\lambda_k^{[r]}$ is the proportion for the right branch. The term $\\delta[w_i - k]$ is 1 if the true class $w_i$ is $k$, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The log likelihood $L$ is not a smooth function of the threshold $\\tau$, and so in practice we maximize the log likelihood by empirically trying a number of different threshold values and choosing the one that gives the best result (i.e., the best split according to the log-likelihood objective).\n",
    "\n",
    "We then perform this same procedure recursively: the data that pass to the left branch has a new randomly chosen classifier $q'[x]$ applied to them and a new threshold $\\tau'$ is chosen that splits it again. This can be done without recourse to the data in the right branch, and vice versa. This process continues until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum depth, minimum number of samples per node).\n",
    "\n",
    "When we classify a new data example $x^*$, we pass it down the tree according to the learned functions $q[\\cdot]$ and thresholds $\\tau$ at each node until it reaches one of the leaves. The posterior distribution $Pr(w^*|x^*)$ over the world state (class) $w^*$ is set to $\\text{Cat}_{w^*}[\\lambda]$ where the parameters $\\lambda$ are the categorical parameters (calculated using Eq. 9.64 during training) associated with this leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "The random classification tree is attractive because it is very fast to train – after all, most of its parameters (the functions $q[x]$) are chosen randomly. It can also be trained with very large amounts of data as its complexity is linear in the number of data examples $I$ (assuming the number of thresholds tested per node is constant or logarithmic in $I$).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two important variations on this model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Fern:** A fern is a tree where the randomly chosen functions $q[\\cdot]$ at each *level* of the tree are constrained to be the same. In other words, the data that pass through the left and right branches at any node *at a given depth* are subsequently acted on by the same function (although the threshold level $\\tau$ may optionally be different in each branch). In practice, this means that every data point is acted on by the same sequence of functions as it traverses the tree depth. This can make implementation extremely efficient when we are evaluating the classifier repeatedly, as the same set of function responses can be calculated once and reused for threshold comparisons at each node of a given level."

    "2.  A **random forest** is a collection of random trees, each of which uses a different randomly chosen set of functions $q[\\cdot]$. By averaging together the probabilities $Pr(w^*|x^*)$ predicted by these trees, a more robust classifier is produced. One way to think of this is as approximating the Bayesian approach; we are constructing the final answer by taking a weighted sum of the predictions suggested by different sets of parameters (in this case, different tree structures and associated parameters).\n",

    "### 9.11 Relation to non-probabilistic models\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we have described a family of probabilistic algorithms for classification. Each is based on maximizing either the log Bernoulli probability of the training class labels given the data (two-class case) or the log categorical probability of the training class labels given the data (multi-class case).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is more common in the computer vision literature to use non-probabilistic classification algorithms such as the **multilayer perceptron**, **adaboost** or **support vector classification**. At their core, these algorithms optimize different objective functions and so are neither directly equivalent to each other, nor to the models in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to describe the less common probabilistic algorithms because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* they have no serious disadvantages relative to non-probabilistic techniques,\n",
    "* they naturally produce estimates of certainty (probabilities),\n",
    "* they are easily extensible to the multi-class case whereas non-probabilistic algorithms usually rely on one-against-all formulations, and\n",
    "* they are more easily related to one another and to the rest of the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, it can reasonably be argued that the dominance of non-probabilistic approaches to classification is largely for historical reasons. We will now briefly describe the relationship between our models and common non-probabilistic approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **multi-layer perceptron** or **neural network** is very similar to our nonlinear logistic regression model in the special case where the nonlinear transform consists of a set of sigmoid functions applied to linear projections of data (e.g., $z_k = \\arctan[\\alpha_k^T x]$). In the MLP, learning is known as **back propagation** and the transformed variable $z$ is known as the **hidden layer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adaboost** is very closely related to the the **logitboost** model described in this chapter, but adaboost is not probabilistic. Performance of the two algorithms is similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **support vector machine (SVM)** is similar to **relevance vector classification**; it is a kernelized classifier that depends sparsely on the data. It has the advantage that its objective function is convex, whereas the objective function in relevance vector classification is non-convex and only guarantees to converge to a local minimum. However, the SVM has several disadvantages: it does not assign certainty to its class predictions, it is not so easily extended to the multi-class case, it produces"

    "solutions that are less sparse than **relevance vector classification**, and it places more restrictions on the form of the kernel function. In practice, classification performance of the two models is again similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "We now present a number of examples of the use of classification in computer vision from the research literature. In many of the examples, the method used was non-probabilistic (e.g., **adaboost**), but is very closely related to the algorithms in this chapter, and one would not expect the performance to differ significantly if these were substituted.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gender classification\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithms in this chapter were motivated by the problem of gender detection in unconstrained facial images. The goal is to assign a label $w \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ indicating whether a small patch of an image $x$ contains a male or a female face.\n",

    "Prince & Aghajanian (2009) developed a system of this type. First, a bounding box around the face was identified using a face detector (see next section). The data within this bounding box was resized to $60 \\times 60$, converted to grayscale and histogram equalized. The resulting image was convolved with a bank of Gabor functions and the filtered images sampled at regular intervals that were proportionate to the wavelength to create a final feature vector of length 1064. Each dimension was whitened to have mean zero and unit standard deviation. Chapter 13 contains information about these and other preprocessing methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "A training database of 32000 examples was used to learn a nonlinear logistic regression model of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Pr(w_i | x_i) = \\text{Bern}_{w_i} \\left[ \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp \\left(-\\phi_0 - \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\phi_k f[x_i, \\xi_k] \\right)} \\right] \\quad (9.65)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the nonlinear functions $f[\\cdot]$ were arc tangents of linear projections of the data so that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f[x_i, \\xi_k] = \\arctan[\\xi_k^T x_i] \\quad (9.66)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual the data were augmented by prepending a 1 so the projection vectors $\\{\\xi_k\\}$ were of length $D + 1$. This model was learned using an incremental approach so that at each stage the parameters $\\phi_0$, $\\phi_k$ and $\\xi_k$ were modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system achieved 87.5% performance with $K = 300$ arc tangent functions on a challenging real-world database that contained large variations in scale, pose, lighting and expression similar to the faces in fig.1. Human observers managed only 95% performance on the same database using the resized face region alone.\n",

    "a) Each weak classiﬁer consists of the response of the image to a Haar- like ﬁlter, which is then passed through a step function. b) The ﬁrst two weak classiﬁers learned in this implementation have clear interpretations: the ﬁrst responds to the dark horizontal region belonging to the eyes and the second responds to the relative brightness of the bridge of the nose. c) The data passes through a cascade: most regions can be quickly rejected after evaluating only a few weak classiﬁers as they look nothing like faces. More ambiguous regions undergo further preprocessing. d) Example results. Adapted from Viola & Jones (2004)."
