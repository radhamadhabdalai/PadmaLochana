    "\n",
    "An imaging device works by collecting light reflected from objects in the scene and creating a two-dimensional image. If we want to use the image to gain information about the scene, we need to be familiar with the nature of this process that we would like to be able to reverse. The word “camera” is the Latin word for “chamber”. It was originally used in reference to the **camera obscura** (dark chamber), a dark, enclosed room used by artists and scientists in the sixteenth century to observe the projected image of an external object through a small hole. Over time, the term was adapted to refer to the devices used to capture and record images, such as cameras.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest geometric model of image formation is the **pinhole camera**, represented in Fig. 2.1; it is based on the same principle as the camera obscura. The tiny hole (pinhole) in one wall of the room lets in a ray of light for each point in the scene so that an image of the outside world is drawn on the opposite wall (image plane).\n"
